# Constructor-Hangman
This project is a Node.js assignment for Week 11 of UNC Coding Bootcamp.

## Technologies Used
This simple Node.js application uses the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer "Inquirer")  npm package to prompt the user to input letters, and provides feedback about the user's progress.

The game is played entirely through the terminal. 

Enjoy!
